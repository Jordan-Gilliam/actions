# energizeai/actions

Welcome to `energizeai/actions`, by Energize AI. Spark is designed to run a variety of tasks such as sending emails via Google, creating issues in Linear, and more. This repository is dedicated to community contributions for developing new actions for Spark. In addition, we are building out our Actions Development Enviornment (ADE) to make it easier to develop actions.
