# ai-actions

Welcome to `ai-actions`, by Energize AI. We're building the foundations for a new AI-centered internet, in which Actions are a core building block. Our agent Spark is designed to run a variety of tasks, such as sending emails via Google, creating issues in Linear, and more. This repository is dedicated to community contributions for developing new type-safe actions. The Actions Development Enviornment (ADE) allows developers to quickly build and test new actions.

Feel free to email info@energize.ai with questions or post a [feedback](https://spark.energize.ai/feedback) to Spark.
