## Processing

```typescript:index.ts
for (const result of results) {
  if (result.isError) {
    // do something here
    continue
  }

  // now TS knows that status is 'success' and data will not be undefined
  console.log(result.data)

  // we can narrow the type further by checking actionId
  if (result.actionId === "myActionId") {
    // now TS knows that data is the output of myActionId
    console.log(result.data)
  }
}
```
