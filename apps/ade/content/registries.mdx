#### Group actions into a registry

# Registries

A registry is a collection of actions that can be used together. All you have to do is pass them as an array to the `createActionsRegistry` function.

It will return a `Record` of `ActionId` to `Action` mappings.

```typescript:index.ts
import { createActionsRegistry } from "ai-actions"

const ActionsRegistry = createActionsRegistry([
  myAction1,
  myAction2,
  myAction3,
])

const myAction1 = ActionsRegistry["myAction1"]
```

```typescript:ReturnType
{
  [ActionId]: Action
}
```
