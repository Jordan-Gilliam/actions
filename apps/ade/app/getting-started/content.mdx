#### Let's get building ðŸš€

# Getting Started

First, make sure you have cloned the repository and installed all the dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands in the root directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/energizeai/actions.git

cd actions

npm install
```

To run ADE, you can use the following command in the root directory.

```bash
npm run ade:dev
```

ðŸ’¡ To automate these steps for you, we recommend using our Code-Gen tool. You can run the following command in the root directory. It will create a custom Action template for you.
```bash
npm run generate:action
```

We also recommend checking out all the existing actions we have in the **Actions Registry** located at `/packages/registry/src`. You can use these as a reference for building your own.

---

All actions live in the **Actions Registry** located at `/packages/registry/src`. To start making a new one, please make a new `.tsx` file in the `src` directory. For convention, please use Dash Case for the file name (e.g. `my-new-action.tsx`).

Once you have created the file, you can start building by following the 5 steps below:

### 1. Assign Metadata

To start, you should call the `createAction` method from `@energizeai/types` and pass in an object with the following properties:

- `metadata`: This is an object that contains all the information about the action. It includes the title, description, resource, avatar, defaultKeywords, and apiReference.

```tsx
const GoogleSendMailAction = createAction({
  metadata: createActionMetadata({
    title: "Send Email",
    description: "Send an email with the Gmail API",
    resource: "Google",
    avatar: {
      light: "/logos/google.svg",
      dark: "/logos/google.svg",
    },
    defaultKeywords: ["send-email"],
    apiReference:
      "https://www.google.com/search?q=google+send+mail+api&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8",
  }),
})
```

### 2. Define the Input Schema

Next, we are going to want to define the input schema for our action. The input schema must be a [zod](https://zod.dev) schema.

You must include a `.describe()` call on each field to provide a description of the input. This description will be used to generate the prompts and details page for your action.

Here is what it would look like for the SendEmail action:

```tsx
.setInputSchema(
  z.object({
    subject: z.string().describe("The subject of the email"),
    body: z.string().describe("The body of the email"),
    to: z
      .array(
        z.object({
          email: z
            .string()
            .email()
            .describe("The email address to send the email to"),
        })
      )
      .describe("The email address to send the email to"),
  })
)
```

### 3. Define the Output Schema

---

#### Option 1: JSON Data Output

In this example, the GetGoogleContact action is `GET`ting data from Google Contacts. The output is a JSON object that adheres to the Zod schema below. No React Component is specified.

```tsx
.setOutputSchema(z.object({
  displayName: z.string().describe("The display name of the contact"),
  primaryEmailAddress: z
    .string()
    .email()
    .describe("The email address of the contact"),
}))
```

---

#### Option 2: React Component Output

In this example, the SendEmailInput action is POSTing data to Google. The output is a React component that asks for confirmation for the action. In this case, there is no output JSON, so we should `setOutputSchema(z.void())` before defining the component. See the Template for an example.

For building forms, we recommend you use [ShadCN + React Hook Form](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form).

You will have access to the following props:

- `data`: Will include: isLoading, isError, isSuccess, input, onSubmit
- `displayState`: The state of the component (skeleton, placeholder, or active)
- `inputSchema`: The zod input schema for the action
- `metadata`: The metadata for the action

```tsx
.setOutputSchema(z.void())
.setOutputComponent(({ data, displayState, inputSchema, metadata }) => {
  // create your component here

  // This is a skeleton component (loading state)
  if (displayState === "skeleton") return <div>skeleton component</div>

  // This is a placeholder component (display state)
  if (displayState === "placeholder") return <div>placeholder component</div>

  // This is the active component (form state)
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Send Email</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>
          Are you sure you want to send an email?
        </CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        ...
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter className="justify-end gap-2">
        <Button onClick={ () => data.onSubmit(data.input) }
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  )
})
```

### 4. Configure Authentication

We felt this was important enough to give it its own section. Please see the [Authentication](/authentication) page.

```tsx
.setAuthType("OAuth" | "Token" | "None")
```

### 5. Define the Action

Finally, we are going to define the action. The good news is we can do this in a **type-safe** way. You will have type-safe access to the input data as well as any authentication data.

```tsx
.setActionFunction(async ({ input, auth, userData }) => {
  // Add your action function logic here

  console.log(auth) // type safe access to the auth data
  console.log(input) // type safe access to the input data
  console.log(userData) // type safe access to the user data

  return // return your output schema here
})
```

Yay! You have successfully created a new action. Now you can use it in the ADE. ðŸš€ 

Note: Make sure you have added your action to `/packages/registry/src/index.ts`
