# Introduction

Welcome to the Actions Development Environment (ADE), a simple way to develop actions.

Feel free to email info@energize.ai with questions, post a [feedback](https://spark.energize.ai/feedback) to Spark, or reach out on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/H5RXqCJU)!

## What is an Action?

You can think of an action as a Function that [Spark](https://spark.energize.ai) (or any LLM) can call. It takes input information from the user, runs code within the function (an API call), and usually outputs information. There are two types of Actions: `GET`s or `POST`s. `GET` Actions retrieve and report information to the user (e.g. retrieving the weather), while `POST` Actions send information onto the internet (e.g. sending an email).

## Why ADE?

ADE will take care of all the overhead required to run an action. It will handle the API calls, the input and output, and the authentication. This way, you can focus on writing the code that makes the action work.

Furthermore, ADE will host the `Action Registry`, which is a collection of all the actions that have been developed. This way, you can easily share your actions with others, and use actions that others have developed. All actions are built in Typescript following a standard format in order to increase the developer experience.
