# Authentication

A big strength of ADE is that it takes care of the heavy lifting when it comes to authentication. It provides a simple and consistent way to authenticate users across different actions.

**When you authenticate yourself with an Action, ADE will store your credentials locally on a sqlite.db file on your computer. Only you will have access to these credentials.**

---

ADE currently supports three types of authentication:

### 1. No Authentication

This is the easiest one of them all. All you have to do is add this after you have defined your output schema/component.

```tsx
.setAuthType("None")
```

With this setting, users will not have to authenticate themselves to use your action.

### 2. Token (API Key)

This is the most common type of authentication. You can use this if you have an API key that you want users to use to authenticate themselves.

Some important things to note:

- `customDataSchema`: What happens if you not only want to collect an API key, but also an organization name and a branch name? This is where Custom Data comes in. You can specify what other data you want to collect from the user. Once specified, you will have access to this type-safe data while writing your action function.
- `validateToken`: It is helpful to validate for users that the token they gave is correct. Typically, we would want to make a quick validation API call here to make sure the token is valid. This function will be called upon submission of a token when authenticating.

```tsx
.setAuthType("Token")
.setTokenData({
  humanReadableDescription: "A description as to what the token is",
  humanReadableName: "The name of the application",
  generatingTokenReferenceURL: "A link documenting how others can generate a token",
  button: {
    text: "Continue with (Google, Linear, Slack, etc.)",
  },
  customDataSchema: z.object({
    // Add your custom data schema here
    organization: z.string().describe("Please enter your organization name"),
  }),
  validateToken: async ({ auth }) => {
    // Add your custom token validation logic here
    return { isValid: true }
  },
})
```

### 3. OAuth

This is typically the most complex to setup, but this is where ADE really shines and does most of the heavy lifting.

Some important things to note:

- `discoveryEndpoint`: The discovery endpoint for the OAuth provider. For example, check out [Google's discovery endpoint](https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration). ADE will use this endpoint to fetch the necessary information to authenticate the user.
- `scopes`: The scopes that you want to request from the user
- `oauthAppGenerationURL`: A link that others can use to generate their own OAuth app for the provider

Specify the discovery endpoint and ADE will take care of the rest (refreshing tokens, revoking tokens, etc). If there is no discovery endpoint, you can manually specify the endpoints.

```tsx
.setAuthType("OAuth")
.setOAuthData({
  humanReadableDescription: "A description as to what the token is",
  humanReadableName: "The name of the application",
  button: {
    text: "Continue with (Google, Linear, Slack, etc.)",
  },
  discoveryEndpoint:
    "ENTER YOUR DISCOVERY ENDPOINT HERE",
  scopes: ["ENTER YOUR SCOPES HERE"],
  oauthAppGenerationURL: "ENTER A LINK TO GENERATE OAUTH APP HERE",
})
```
